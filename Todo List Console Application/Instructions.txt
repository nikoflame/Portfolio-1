Project Idea: Todo List Console Application

Description:
	Create a simple console-based Todo List application in C++.
	This project will allow users to manage their tasks by adding, viewing, updating, and deleting tasks from a list.
	It's a practical project that demonstrates your proficiency in C++ and fundamental programming concepts like data structures, file I/O, and user input/output.

Features to Implement:

	Task Management: Users can add new tasks to the list, including a title, description, due date, and priority.
	Task Viewing: Users can view all tasks in the list, including details such as title, description, due date, priority, and status (completed or pending).
	Task Updating: Users can update existing tasks by marking them as completed, changing the due date, or updating the description.
	Task Deletion: Users can delete tasks from the list.
	Save/Load from File: Implement functionality to save the task list to a file and load it back when the application starts.
		This ensures that tasks persist between sessions.

Additional Features (Optional):

	Task Sorting: Allow users to sort tasks by due date, priority, or status.
	Search and Filter: Implement functionality to search for tasks by title, description, or due date, and filter tasks by priority or status.
	User Authentication: Add basic user authentication to restrict access to the Todo List, requiring users to log in with a username and password.
	Graphical User Interface (GUI): For an extra challenge, consider implementing a simple graphical user interface using a library like Qt or wxWidgets.

Skills Demonstrated:

	C++ Programming Skills: Demonstrates your ability to write clean, organized, and efficient C++ code.
	File I/O: Shows your proficiency in reading from and writing to files to store data persistently.
	Data Structures: Utilizes data structures such as arrays, linked lists, or vectors to manage tasks efficiently.
	User Input/Output: Implements console-based user interfaces for interacting with the application.
	Problem-Solving: Requires problem-solving skills to design and implement the application's features effectively.

Potential Enhancements:

	Once you've completed the basic functionality, you can continue to enhance the application by adding more features, improving user interface design, or optimizing performance.
	Additionally, you can refactor the code to make it more modular, add error handling and validation, or implement unit tests to ensure reliability.
